I am currently enrolled in Course 2 of the Machine Learning Specialization, titled "Advanced Algorithms." 
This course dives into more advanced and sophisticated algorithms used in the field of Machine Learning. Throughout the course, 
I will be expanding my knowledge and skills to tackle complex ML challenges effectively.

By the end of this course, I aim to have a deep understanding of these advanced algorithms and their applications. 
I plan to apply my newfound knowledge and skills by updating my repository with projects and code implementations, showcasing my proficiency in solving complex ML problems. 
This course will undoubtedly expand my toolkit and pave the way for more sophisticated and accurate machine learning models in the future.
